JMLab OpenAI Java Client
========================
JMLab OpenAI Java Client is a Java library that provides the option for either synchronous or asynchronous requests to
OpenAI's API. Asynchronous requests are achieved through the use of Server-Sent Events (SSE) with the stream=true
option. This allows the client to receive results as soon as they become available, without blocking the thread, making
it useful for applications that require real-time updates, such as chat applications.

On the other hand, the synchronous option uses the stream=false option, which blocks until the results are available.

The library has a straightforward interface and is customizable, making it easy for developers to integrate OpenAI's AI
capabilities into their Java applications.
